# DES-evolutionary-algorithm

Implementation of the evolutionary algorithm DES - Differential Evolution Strategy. The project has been developed durign the course at Warsaw University of Tehchnology. 
The aim of the project was to implement algorithm and test it's convergence as well as to compare computation time with the implementation of DES in R.
